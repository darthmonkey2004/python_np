This is a python based media player that uses vlc python bindings and (if in remote mode) ssh/sftp mounts to organize, database, and control playback of video, music, and audio files.

To install, first clone the repo (insure git is installed i.e. sudo apt-get install git):
git clone "https://github.com/darthmonkey2004/python_np.git"

Then, open a command prompt (ctrl + alt + t), and cd into the downloaded directory.
cd python_np

Finally, run the setup script. If it fails, make executable (sudo chmod a+x setup_np.sh), and try again.
./setup_np.sh

The installer will ask if you want to set up ssh authentication. If this is already done, you may skip this step.
TODO: code in a decent way of locating the previously downloaded source directory to avoid the need to provide the path at setup script launch.
Then, it will install the necessary apt packages (if you don't use apt, you'll need to install these with your preferred package manager)
Finally, it will install np from the downloaded tarball in python_np/dist, and install the required python packages from requirements.txt

That's it! To run, just open a command prompt and type 'np'.

Additional:
There are several helper scripts included with this. The first one is np.remote, which adds a cli based remote control (use -l flag for local use), for those
who just can't seem to help themselves from a terminal window (like this guy, for instance). Also good for setting debug=True/False when chasing down issues.
There is also mkmedialist (both are installed to '/home/$USER/.local/bin') which will search for a structured filing system (movies in 'Movies', series in 'Series', etc.) and create
a playable playlist file (medialist.txt) usable in mplayer, mpv, and vlc. 

This software is provided AS IS, as I've already ran down the 'consumer support help desk' road, and am not super itching to jump down it again. However, I will
try and respond to issues and questions if you should have them.

Note*
launcher script and other helpers are installed to the local user's bin ('/home/user/.local/bin'). 
setup_np.sh should ammend your .bashrc file with the correct path, and will back old path up to "$HOME/oldpath.temp". can be restored using 'restore_path' function in setup_np.sh
If the above fails to modify PATH variable, you'll need to add it by editing ~/.bashrc and hardcoding it...


Enjoy!

TODO: 
scan_music.py works to scan media directory for music files to add to the sql database, still working on scan_movies and scan_series. Will create a helper script to launch these
(also installed to 'home/$USER/.local/bin')
